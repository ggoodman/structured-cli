# structured-cli

Structure your CLI application as a series of nested [Categories](#Categories) and [Commands](#Commands).

## Key Features

* Built off of the proven command-line argument parser [argparse](https://www.npmjs.com/package/argparse).
* Lets you structure your CLI tool as a set of arbitrarily nested [Categories](#Categories) and [Commands](#Commands).
* Lets you easily re-use logic between different commands.
* Makes it easy to alias one command to another.
* Will provide intuitive help without the headache of setting it up.



## Installing it

```bash
npm install structured-cli
```

## Using it

```js
var Cli = require('structured-cli');
var Widgets = require('./widget-service'); // Imaginary api

// The 'root' of our app is an anonymous category
var app = Cli.createApp();

app.addChild(Cli.command('init', {
    description: 'Initialize the tool',
    handler: function (args) {
        // Initialize the tool
    },
}));


// You can nest categories as deep as you would like
var widgets = Cli.category('widgets', {
    description: 'Manage your inventory of widgets.'
});

var listCommand = Cli.command('ls', {
    description: 'List your widgets',
    options: {
        color: {
            alias: 'c'
            description: 'Only list widgets of the given color.',
            type: 'string',
        }
    }
    handler: function (args) {
        Widgets.list(args, function (err, widgets) {
            if (err) throw err; // Thrown errors will print the error
                                // and print the help.
            
            // Pretty-print your list of widgets however you'd like
        });
    }
});

widgets.addChild(listCommand);
// The ls command is now available at `widgets.commands.ls`

// Alias `widgets ls` to the top-level command `widgets ls`
app.addChild(listCommand);

// Add the `widgets` category to the CLI
app.addChild(widgets);

Cli.run(app);
```
